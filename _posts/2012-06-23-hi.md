and welcome to my blog.

I'm Tim, iOS developer from Cologne, Germany. I'm working full-time at [simfy](http://simfy.de) and try to find as much time as possible to work on my first own app, [Eisenhower](http://eisenhower.me), which I'm building together with the extremely talented [@kwiat](https://twitter.com/kwiat).

I set up this blog with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to have a place to share my thoughts, ideas and solutions which hopefully are useful to anyone.

Want to get in touch? Find me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/tibr) or send a [mail](mailto:tim@tibr.me).
