and welcome to my blog.

I'm Tim, iOS developer from Cologne, Germany. I'm working full-time at <a href="http://simfy.de" target="_blank">simfy</a> and try to find as much time as possible to work on my first own app, <a href="http://eisenhower.me" target="_blank">Eisenhower</a>, which I'm building together with the extremely talented <a href="https://twitter.com/kwiat" target="_blank">@kwiat</a>.

I set up this blog with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> to have a place to share my thoughts, ideas and solutions which hopefully are useful to anyone.

Want to get in touch? Find me on <a href="http://twitter.com/tibr" target="_blank">twitter</a> or send a [mail](mailto:tim@tibr.me).
