Last week, I had my last day at <a href="http://www.simfy.de" target="_blank">simfy</a> and hopefully my last day as an employee for a long time. Starting February 1st, I'll start working on <a href="http://www.rheinfabrik.de" target="_blank">Rheinfabrik</a> full-time. <a href="http://www.eisenhower.me" target="_blank">EISENHOWER</a> was very successful and <a href="https://twitter.com/kwiat" target="_blank">@kwiat</a> and I want to put more energy and time into it.

At last year's <a href="http://objcgn.com" target="_blank">Objective-Cologne</a> I talked to <a href="https://twitter.com/krugazor" target="_blank">a</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/carltongibson" target="_blank">lot</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/drewmccormack" target="_blank">of</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/massivevector" target="_blank">great</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/StuFFmc" target="_blank">people</a> who are their own boss and inspired me to take the risk and start my own business. At Rheinfabrik, we'll try to find as much time as possible to create apps we love. However, we also need to pay our rent. We decided not to raise money because we want to stay independent and not have a boss again. That's why we chose to take the hard route and do contract work in the beginning.

I'm excited to see what the future holds for us, it will most likey be an interesting, hard and awesome time! Most of my blog posts will be published over at the <a href="http://blog.rheinfabrik.de/" target="_blank">Rheinfabrik Blog</a> which you should definitely check out! One of our goals is to contribute to the open source community and we've already released our first <a href="http://blog.rheinfabrik.de/blog/2013/01/01/introducing-rfoverlayscrollview/" target="_blank">cocoa component</a>.

So if you need a high-quality app, TDD or Core Data help, are a freelancer (we'll probably need some) or just want to say hi, get in touch via <a href="mailto:hi@rheinfabrik.de">mail</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/rheinfabrik" target="_blank">twitter</a>.
